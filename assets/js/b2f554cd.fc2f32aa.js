However, by providing integrated build options for the **Ext JS SDK**, it is best suited for environments where the **Sencha** framework is already being used or will be used.\\n\\nFor using the tool, all that is required is a working [Node.js](https://node.js) installation on your machine. The scaffolding process can then be started by typing\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-siesta@latest\\n```\\n\\non the console. `create-siesta` will then guide you through the installation process and also consider the environment (aka _current working directory_) it was invoked in, by falling back to already existing **Ext JS** sources for example, or any other package requirements already available.\\n\\n![](./img/create-siesta-cli.gif)\\n\\n\\nOnce `create-siesta` is finished, a folder (defaulting to `tests`) will be available with your project that contains a scaffolded **Siesta** environment with templates for additional and future tests you and your team can implement. Tests can then be started with\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run siesta:test\\n```\\n\\n`create-siesta` builds upon an already available helper tool for creating tests with **Siesta**, namely [@coon-js/siesta-lib-helper](https://github.com/coon-js/siesta-lib-helper) which is already widely used throughout the **conjoon** project and the packages it depends on. This means that you will have an additional control at hand with the **Siesta** application that allows for switching between toolkit dependent tests and dynamically changing timeout values used with \\n\\n```javascript\\nt.waitForMs()\\n```\\n\\nin tests.\\n\\n| ![](./img/siesta-lib-helper-ctrl.png)                                                                                                                                                                                         |\\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| _The additional control made available by siesta-lib-helper allows for switching between the modern `M` and classic `C` toolkit and provides a list of timeout values that can be globally used with t.waitForMs() in tests._ |\\n\\n## Documentation\\nThe documentation for `create-siesta` can be found [here](/docs/api/misc/@coon-js/create-siesta), the sources are available with the [coon.js](https://github.com/coon-js) organization at **GitHub**, which provides a collection of useful tools for rapid **Sencha Ext JS** application development, and spawned from the **conjoon** open source project."},{"id":"/2022/06/06/installer-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/06/06/installer-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/conjoon/conjoon.github.io/edit/main/blog/2022-06-06-installer-update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-06-installer-update/index.md","title":"conjoon installer updates","description":"Creating a custom labeled version of conjoon has never been easier.","date":"2022-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 6, 2022","tags":[{"label":"update","permalink":"/blog/tags/update"},{"label":"installer","permalink":"/blog/tags/installer"},{"label":"create-conjoon","permalink":"/blog/tags/create-conjoon"},{"label":"npm","permalink":"/blog/tags/npm"},{"label":"initializer","permalink":"/blog/tags/initializer"}],"readingTime":1.01,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Thorsten Suckow-Homberg","title":"Senior Software Developer & Trainer at eyeworkers GmbH, Germany","url":"http://twitter.com/ThorstenSuckow","email":"thorsten@suckow-homberg.de","twitter":"ThorstenSuckow","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1521112762902011904/rrKSXgUq_400x400.jpg","key":"ThorstenSuckow"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"conjoon installer updates","authors":["ThorstenSuckow"],"tags":["update","installer","create-conjoon","npm","initializer"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing create-siesta","permalink":"/blog/2022/07/15/create-siesta"},"nextItem":{"title":"Releasing conjoon 1.0.0-beta.0","permalink":"/blog/2022/06/01/pre-release"}},"content":"![](./img/create-conjoon.0.22.gif)\\n\\nCreating a custom labeled version of **conjoon** has never been easier. \\n\\nThe installer (i.e. [initializer](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init)) for **conjoon** received an update to make setting up a local installation of the frontend more convenient and more intuitive.\\n\\nThe installer requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **16.14** or above and is started by typing \\n```bash\\nnpx create-conjoon@latest \\n```\\n\\non the command line.
