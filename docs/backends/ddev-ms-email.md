.ddev/Docker configuration providing standalone server for [lumen-app-email](lumen-app-email).

## Installation

#### Prerequisites
Please make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed and running.

### Starting DDEV

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/conjoon/ddev-ms-email
$ cd ./ddev-ms-email
$ ddev start
```

DDEV will start composer for installing and setting up **lumen-app-email**.
If - for some reason - composer fails to start, connect to the server
by typing 

```shell
$ ddev ssh
```

You can then manually invoke the install process of composer:

```shell
$ ddev ssh
```

## Configuration
DDEV-configuration can be found in `./ddev/config.yaml`. Adjust to your needs.
