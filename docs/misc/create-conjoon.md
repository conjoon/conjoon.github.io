## Installation Settings
The following guides you through the options available during the installation.

The site path is computed relative to the current working directory.
:::note
Make sure to adjust the meta fields found in the `package.json` (repository, author and such) if you plan to fork **conjoon** and create your own project from it.

### Installation Type

   - `quick`: Will install **conjoon** using its latest release and with demo data from the development release. The production build will be configured with fake endpoints, returning mock data in its responses. 
   - `custom`

### `Base url for auth`

- _default_: `<latest release>`

Provides a list of the last 5 releases, and a text input to manually enter the required version, if the user wants to install an older release of **conjoon**. Requested versions will be looked up in the NPM registry. A message will be shown if the release was not found in the registry 

:::tip
Use the **quick** installation to get the **conjoon** frontend running locally. You can always configure the application to a later point for connecting to existing [backends](/docs/backends/overview)
