ðŸŽ‰ 5 years after the (almost) [first commit](https://github.com/conjoon/conjoon/commit/ca075e548a644011e0d9fbaa3321bcff7aa8f998) to **conjoon**'s [new home](https://github.com/conjoon/conjoon), I'm happy to announce the immediate availability of the first public pre-release of **conjoon**, an open source email client built with JavaScript, PHP and great tools from the **open source** community.

Type

```bash
npx create-conjoon@latest 
```

then 

```bash
cd target_folder
npm run stage 
```
to get started, and don't miss out on the [documentation](/docs).

While I'm confident that **conjoon** can take its first steps in a production environment, expect a stable first release to be available in the coming days. Until then, a few additions to the documentation and the [guides](/docs/category/guides) will be made.

**Happy coding! ðŸŽˆ **
