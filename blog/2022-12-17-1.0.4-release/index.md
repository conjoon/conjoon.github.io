üéÑ I'm happy to announce **conjoon 1.0.4**, an interim release that brings _Dependency Injection_ to **conjoon**.

Paving the way for [**conjoon 1.1.0**](https://github.com/orgs/conjoon/projects/6) that targets support for runtime-replacable plugins, Dependeny Injection allows for a more supple integration of functionality for  application instances.

If you're interested in how the _Inversion of Control_-Container works in **conjoon**, have a look [at this article](/docs/advanced/dependencyinjection).

The functionality has been refactored into [**coon.core.ioc**](https://github.com/coon-js/extjs-lib-core/tree/main/src/ioc), so if your Ext JS application is in the need of a simple yet powerful and flexible IoC-Container, you're good to go!


 üîî Happy Holidays! ‚ùÑÔ∏è
